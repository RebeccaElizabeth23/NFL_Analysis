# NFL Quarterbacks: Who's worth their weight in passing yards?
  This project uses linear modelling and regression to look at the link between game passing yards and average yearly salary for each f the 71 Quarterbacks in the 2017 main NFL season. Using this data, we can see which Quarterbacks have been a great deal for their club and which were given a large salary but failed to perform. This project makes use of both GGPLOT2 and PLOTLY R plotting packages to visualise the data discussed and is presetned using a Powerpoint feature of R Markdown and Knitr.
